### Features left to implement

* The game sholud also include a counter of correct and incorrect answers which is now only display but not work.

### Credits/Reference

Most of my javascript code comes from the following YouTube tutorials explaining and showing how to create quizzes from begining.

* [Build A Quiz App With JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k&t=690s)
* [Create Quiz Web App using HTML CSS and JavaScript | Quiz App JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHHYz8rZmDU)

* [How To Make Quiz App With Timer Using HTML CSS & JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fbU4z7fPe4&t=979s)

Of course, I tried to create my unique code completely different from the YouTube tutorials, but it's not that simple. In part, I was able to write somewhat different code.
